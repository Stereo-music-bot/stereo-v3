Ah yes, we have a visitor. Welcome! This is the v3 of Stereo, I know what you are thinking, shit code. It is indeed, I really made a mess out of it but don't worry. V4 will be much better.

You can use it, I don't care about selfhosting. Only make sure to make your repo public if you want to make it a public bot and add it to a bot list.

> Stereo is a special music bot, instead of charging 5 euros a month for a volume command everything is free. It's an easy to use system and requires little permissions to work.

**Permissions**

Permissions, why?! Well, without permissions, Stereo might not be able to run properly. Let me explain:

- Read and Send Messages - Without them the bot is not able to respond or see your messages. (required permissions)
- View Channel, Connect, Speak, Use Voice Activity - Voice channel permissions, without them Stereo isn't able to play music (required permissions)
- Manage Messages - Stereo uses these permissions in order to clean up channels. It deletes song selection messages, etc (optional permission)

Do you want to host it yourself? Sure, go ahead. Download the files, run `npm install` make a build (`npm run build`) and start the bot (`java -jar ./lavalink/Lavalink.jar` & `node build/src/bot.js`).
No, well. Check our hosted version out, the latest version and no problems regarding hosting whatsoever. [Invite](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=745665203777306664&scope=bot&permissions=11889920)
